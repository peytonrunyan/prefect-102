    "Well, in the eyes of Prefect 2.0, you are all equal! Prefect 2.0 does not use DAGs for its flows. For those of you who have been previously constrained by DAGs, you’ll be happy to know that Prefect allows you to have branching logic and loops using essentially pure Python syntax. For those of you unfamiliar with DAGs, the key takeaway is that if you can write the logic in Python, you can apply that logic to a Prefect flow.\n",
